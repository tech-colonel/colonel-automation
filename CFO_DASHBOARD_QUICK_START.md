## ⚡ Performance Tips

1. **Initial Load**: First call loads all data (~2-5 sec)
   - Use complete dashboard snapshot endpoint
   
2. **Date Range Filtering**: Reduces data significantly
   - Scope to month/quarter when possible
   
3. **Drill-down**: Fetches transactions on demand
   - Doesn't impact initial dashboard load
   
4. **Export**: Generates file client-side
   - Excel workbook created locally

```bash
# Verify server is running
curl http://localhost:8001/api/health

# Expected response:
# { "status": "ok", "timestamp": "...", "env": "development" }
```

### Check 2: Routes Registered

```

### Check 4: Browser Console
