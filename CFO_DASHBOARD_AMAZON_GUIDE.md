### 2️⃣ Revenue Waterfall (5 Components) - Cash Flow Analysis

**Purpose:** Visualize cash movement from gross to net

```javascript
gross_in
├─ Value: SUM(invoice_amount)
├─ Represents: Total incoming revenue
└─ Flow Position: Entry point

    ↓

gst_out (Liability)
├─ Value: SUM(total_tax_amount)

├─ Note: This is a liability, not actual cash out (yet)
└─ Flow Position: First deduction

    ↓

net_taxable
├─ Value: SUM(invoice_amount) - SUM(total_tax_amount)
├─ Represents: Money after GST liability

- GST Out (18%):           -₹18,000
= Net Taxable:              ₹82,000
+ Shipping Revenue:          ₹5,000
= Total Operating Cash:     ₹87,000
```

### 3️⃣ SKU Breakdown (up to 50 SKUs) - Product Performance

├─ Top 2 SKU %: (Top 2 SKU Revenue / Total Revenue) * 100
├─ Top 5 SKU %: (Top 5 SKU Revenue / Total Revenue) * 100
└─ Use Case: Risk assessment (high concentration = high risk)
```

**Amazon Example:**
```
Rank | SKU        | Product              | Revenue   | Units | Top % Contrib
-----|------------|----------------------|-----------|-------|---------------
1    | FABCON-5L  | Fabric Conditioner   | ₹45,000   | 1500  | 45.0%
2    | DETGEL-500 | Detergent Gel        | ₹35,000   | 700   | 35.0%
3    | SOFTENER-2 | Fabric Softener      | ₹20,000   | 400   | 20.0%
```

### 4️⃣ Fulfillment Mix (2 Channels) - Logistics Analysis

├─ Formula: SUM(invoice_amount) WHERE fulfillment_channel = 'AFN'
├─ Represents: Revenue from Amazon fulfilled orders
├─ Characteristics: Amazon controls logistics, prime eligible
└─ Typical %: 10-20% (higher = more operational cost)

mfn_percentage
├─ Formula: (MFN Revenue / Gross Revenue) * 100
├─ Target: 85%+ for cost optimization

afn_percentage
├─ Formula: (AFN Revenue / Gross Revenue) * 100
├─ Target: <15% (unless strategic)
```

**Cost Implications:**
```
MFN (Seller Fulfilled):
├─ Seller overhead: Storage + Packaging + Shipping
├─ Typical cost: 5-8% of revenue
└─ Margin: Better for high-ticket items

AFN (Amazon Fulfilled):
├─ Amazon fee: 10-15% of revenue
├─ Prime eligibility: Boosts sales
└─ Margin: Better for low-cost, high-volume items
```

'DC'        → Debit Card
'UPI'       → UPI Transfer (instant settlement)
'NB'        → Net Banking
'WL'        → Wallet (Amazon Pay)
'EMI'       → EMI/Installment (longer settlement)

Per method:

EMI:               Longer payment cycles (30-90 days)
```

### 6️⃣ Geographic Analysis (State-wise) - Regional Performance

└─ Purpose: Identify over-concentration risks
```

**Tax Implication Matrix:**
```
Intra-State (Same state as business):
├─ CGST @ 9% + SGST @ 9% = 18% total
└─ Filed in: GSTR-1 as Intra-state B2B

Inter-State (Different state):
├─ IGST @ 18%
└─ Filed in: GSTR-1 as Inter-state B2B

Union Territory:
├─ UTGST @ 0% (Special rates)

├─ Claimable: Against GST liability
└─ Impact: Reduces net GST payable

net_gst_cash_outflow
├─ Formula: Total GST Collected - ITC (Input Tax Credit) - TCS Credit

## 🧮 Calculation Examples for Sales-Amazon

### Example: April 2026 Sales Analysis

**Sample Data:**
```
20 invoices processed
2,850 units shipped across 18 states
18 different SKUs
15 MFN orders, 5 AFN orders
```

**KPI Strip Calculation:**

```javascript
// Raw aggregation from database:
invoices = [
  { invoice_amount: 5000, tax_exclusive_gross: 4200, total_tax_amount: 800 },
  { invoice_amount: 4500, tax_exclusive_gross: 3800, total_tax_amount: 700 },
  // ... 18 more invoices
]

// KPI Strip Metrics:
gross_revenue = 5000 + 4500 + ... = 100,000
net_taxable = 4200 + 3800 + ... = 82,000
gst_collected = 800 + 700 + ... = 18,000
avg_order_value = 100,000 / 20 = 5,000
total_orders = 20
irn_compliance = (19 accepted / 20 total) * 100 = 95%
```

**Revenue Waterfall:**

```
Gross In:          ₹100,000
- GST Out:          -₹18,000
= Net Taxable:      ₹82,000
+ Shipping Rev:      +₹5,000
= Total Cash:        ₹87,000

GSTR-3B Filing:
- GST Collected:     ₹18,000
- ITC (Input Tax):    -₹2,500  (if purchases have GST)
- TCS Credit:          -₹200
= Net GST Due:       ₹15,300  (payable by May 20th)
```

**SKU Concentration:**

```
Top SKU Analysis:
├─ FABCON-5L:      45,000  (45%)
├─ DETGEL-500:     35,000  (35%)
├─ SOFTENER-2:     20,000  (20%)
└─ Others:              0   (0%)

Concentration Risk:
├─ Top 1: 45% (MODERATE - not overly dependent)
├─ Top 2: 80% (HIGH - focus on these)
└─ Recommendation: Diversify product mix
```

**Tax Breakdown by State:**

```
Maharashtra:       30,000 (30%)  [9% CGST + 9% SGST = ₹5,400]
Gujarat:          25,000 (25%)  [18% IGST = ₹4,500]
Delhi:            20,000 (20%)  [18% IGST = ₹3,600]
Karnataka:        15,000 (15%)  [18% IGST = ₹2,700]
Others:           10,000 (10%)  [Variable]
                 ────────────────────────────
Total:           100,000       [₹18,000 GST]
```

## 🔍 Data Quality Checks

### Pre-Reporting Validations:

```javascript
// 1. All required fields present
√ invoice_amount ≠ NULL
√ total_tax_amount ≠ NULL
√ quantity ≥ 0
√ ship_to_state provided

// 2. Mathematical consistency
√ invoice_amount = tax_exclusive_gross + total_tax_amount (approx)
√ total_tax_amount = CGST + SGST + IGST + UTGST + Cess (within 1 paise)
√ quantity * unit_price ≈ tax_exclusive_gross (for single items)

// 3. Compliance fields
√ invoice_number format valid
√ irn_number exists if status = 'Accepted'
√ irn_filing_status in ['Accepted', 'Rejected', 'Pending']
√ invoice_date ≤ today

// 4. Geographic consistency
√ ship_to_state in valid Indian states
√ ship_to_state ≠ NULL for IGST calculation
```
